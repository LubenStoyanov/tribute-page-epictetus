        <ul>
          <li>Epictetus was born A.D. 50 at Hierapolis, Phrygia</li>
          <li>His original name is unknown</li>
          <li>epíktētos (ἐπίκτητος) means in Greek "gained" or "aquired"</li>
          <li>
            In his youth he was a slave to Epaphroditos, a secretary to Nero
          </li>
          <li>
            He studied stoic philosophy under Musonius Rufus and became more
            educated.
          </li>
          <li>Under unknown circumstances he became crippled</li>
          <li>
            After he obtained his freedom, he began to teach philosophy in Rome
          </li>
          <li>
            Later he founded a philosophical school in Nicopolis in Epirus,
            Greece
          </li>
          <li>
            His most famous pupil, Arrian, describes him as an powerful speaker
          </li>
          <li>Eminent people wanted to talk with him.</li>
          <li>
            He possessed little and lived a simple life. It's said that he
            didn't need a lock for his house, because there was nothing to steal
          </li>
          <li>
            Most of the time he lived alone until he adopted a friend's child
            who would have died otherwise. A woman helped Epictetus to raise him
            properly. It's unkown if they were married
          </li>
          <li>He died around 135 A.D.</li>
